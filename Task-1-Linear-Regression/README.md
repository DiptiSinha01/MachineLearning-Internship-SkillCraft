# Task 1 – Linear Regression 📈

## 🧠 Objective
As part of my internship at **Skillcraft Technology**, this task focused on building a **Linear Regression** model using Python to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more features. The aim was to demonstrate the ability to implement a supervised machine learning model, train it on structured data, and evaluate its performance.

## 🗂️ Files

- `linear_regression_model.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete model workflow
- `train.csv` – Dataset used for training the model
- `test.csv` – Dataset used to test the model

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Summary

- Loaded and processed the dataset using `pandas`
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model with `scikit-learn`
- Predicted values on unseen test data
- Evaluated the model using the **R² Score**
- Visualized actual vs. predicted values using `matplotlib`

---

## 🧾 Dataset Description

- `train.csv`: Contains columns for input features (`x`) and target variable (`y`)
- `test.csv`: Contains similar feature structure, used for model predictions

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- **R² Score:** `0.61`  
  This indicates that approximately 61% of the variability in the target variable is explained by the model. While there’s room for improvement, this serves as a strong starting point in understanding regression-based modeling.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data handling  
- `scikit-learn` – Model training  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization

---

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with regression models in Python  
- Understood how to train, test, and evaluate a linear model  
- Learned how performance metrics like R² reflect model effectiveness  
- Identified areas for improvement and experimentation
