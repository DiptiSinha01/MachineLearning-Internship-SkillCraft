# Skillcraft Technology | Machine Learning Internship ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the official repository for my **Machine Learning Internship** at **Skillcraft Technology**. This internship offered me an opportunity to apply core data science principles to solve practical problems using real-world datasets. Over the course of the internship, I worked on multiple tasks involving data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation â€” all aimed at sharpening my skills in applied machine learning.

Overview:
The internship was designed to simulate an end-to-end data science workflow:
- Understanding problem statements
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Training and validating models
- Communicating results through visualizations and metrics

Each task in this repository reflects a step forward in building robust, real-world data-driven solutions.
